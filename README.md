# Sign Language Recognition

## Overview
This repository contains a project focused on recognizing sign language gestures using machine learning techniques. The project includes data collection, model training, and inference notebooks to build and evaluate the hand gesture recognition model.

## Contents
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `create_dataset.ipynb`: Notebook for creating and preprocessing the dataset.
- `train_classifier.ipynb`: Notebook for training the hand gesture recognition model.
- `inference_classifier.ipynb`: Notebook for running inference on new data using the trained model.
- `hand_gesture_model.keras`: Pre-trained model file.
- `data.pkl`: Serialized data file used in the project.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Ahmedabdalaziz/Sign-Language.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Sign-Language`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
### Creating the Dataset
Run the `create_dataset.ipynb` notebook to generate and preprocess the dataset.

### Training the Model
Use the `train_classifier.ipynb` notebook to train the hand gesture recognition model.

### Inference
Run the `inference_classifier.ipynb` notebook to perform inference on new hand gesture data using the trained model.
